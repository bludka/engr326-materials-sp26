        "As part of a new discharge permit, a wastewater treatment facility is required to reduce the phosphorus concentration in the water it releases to a small stream channel. This discharged water from the treatment facility into the stream is called the \"effluent\". \n",
        " \n",
        "The channel flow is assumed to be dominated by the facility discharge (i.e., upstream flow is negligible), so the initial in-stream phosphorus concentration at the discharge point equals the effluent concentration. The current effluent phosphorus concentration is 0.90 $\\frac{mg}{L}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The new effluent limit will be determined based on the requirement that the phosphorus concentration in the stream must not exceed 0.05 $\\frac{mg}{L}$ at a location 44.5 $km$ downstream of the discharge point. This location was selected because it is where the stream connects to a larger river. This downstream criterion was established to protect designated beneficial uses, including recreation and drinking water supply."
